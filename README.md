# The ultimate Docker collection

This project is a collection of Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations that aim to provide the most comprehensive and "overkill" setups possible. These configurations are designed to cover a wide range of use cases and to adhere to best practices as closely as possible.

The goal of this project is not just to provide a set of configurations, but to challenge the community to improve and optimize these setups even further. If you think you can do better, I encourage you to take up the challenge!

## Challenge

Think you can create a more optimized, efficient, or creative Dockerfile or Docker Compose configuration? I'd love to see it! Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make your changes. Try to make your Dockerfile or Compose configuration as efficient and effective as possible.
3. Submit a Pull Request with your changes.

I am excited to see what you come up with!
